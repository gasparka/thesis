MASTERS THESIS
==============

This is my masters thesis ``Pyha - Object-Oriented Hardware Description Language based on Python``, that was submitted to ``TTÃœ Thomas Johann Seebeck Department of Electronics`` study plan in 06.2017. I wrote it using Sphinx and was able to get very good Latex output.

This work was graded with ``5`` likely because most of the grading was done based on the presentation. In generally i feel that the written part is relatively weak and has very low academic value..if any.

Mistakes
--------

I picked this topic to get 'free documentation' for the ``Pyha`` project. That alone is a bad start if any academically valuable output is desired.

Writing was hard. I used the 'do simpler things first' approach, known from software programming.
But since i did not have a clear goal, this technique turned into 'do random things and hope the best'. I should have written the introduction and problem statement first and set a clear structure for the work before writing other stuff.

Procrastination was a problem as always. I finished important parts of the thesis week before the final deadline, no time was left for major overhauls.

Failed to learn from my bachelor thesis, that had basically all the same mistakes.
