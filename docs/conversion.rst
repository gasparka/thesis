Conversion
==========
This chapter examines the feasability and means of converting Python code to VHDL.

What about verilog?


Python vs VHDL
--------------
VHDL is known as a strongly typed language in addition to that it is very verbose.
Python is dynamically typed and is basically as least verbose as possible.

Comparison of syntax
--------------------




Problem of types
----------------

Biggest difference and problem between Python and VHDL is the type system.
While in VHDL everything must be typed, Python is fully dynamically typed language, meaning that
types only come into play when the code is executing.


In general there are some different approaches to solve this problem:

    - Determining types from Python source code

How to solve dynamic typed? stuff


Language differences...

Extensions..wehn you can do more in python domain.

Feasability of converting Python to VHDL

Simulation and verification
---------------------------
Requrements...want RTL sim, GATE sim, in loop etc


Essentially this comes downt to being and VHDL simulator inside VHDL simulator. it may sound stupid, but it works for
simulations and synthesys, so i guess it is not stupid.
